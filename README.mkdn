# AMOR - Another Markdown On Rails

## WHAT

AMOR is a fork of the famous project [Markdown on Rails][mor] to use [Rdiscont][rd] instead of [BlueCloth][bc] and improve some test and documentation.

## INSTALLING

If you are using the Rails 2.1 you can use the **script/plugin**

	ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/tapajos/amor.git
	
For other versions you can install by descompressing this [file][tgz] in your vendor/plugins directory.

## DEPENDENCIES

1. [Rdiscont][rd]

## USING

The usage of AMOR is very easy. The only thing that you need to do is create your view using markdown's syntax and use **.text** instead of **.html.erb**

## Version

The current version is **0.0.1** and AMOR is under development and shouldn't be used.

## Licence

Markdown on Rails is released under the MIT licence.
